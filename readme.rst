Purpose
=======
This repository provides a utility to perform rapid prototyping of data-driven
tractography models.

Overview
========

Using the notebooks in this repository assumes a certain file structure:

| project/
| ├──models/
| ├──subjects/

| |     ├──resampled_fibers/

| └──`trk2seeds.ipynb`_

The file system is described shortly, for more details please refer to the
individual files.

models/
-------
Contains keras models trained in `training_conditional_t.ipynb`_, along with
yaml configs, which contain the training parameters.

subjects/
---------
This is the data folder comprising DWI data, training fibers, and their
processed forms.
Specifically, we use T1 and DWI data from the `HCP project`_, and reference
fibers from `TractSeg`_.

* **tracts/** Raw fiber bundles (.trk), downloaded from `TractSeg`_.
* **resampled_fibers/** Fibers with data (.trk), interpolated by `fiber_resampling.ipynb`_
* **predicted_fibers/** Fibers (.trk), predicted by `inference_t.ipynb`_.
* **samples/** Collections of (vin, D, vout) samples (.npz), produced by `generate_conditional_samples_t.ipynb`_.
* **seeds/** Fiber seed files (.npy), generated by `generate_conditional_samples_t.ipynb`_.

entrack/
--------
Folder for a specific model class, in this case Entrack. It defines how its
models are trained (`training_conditional_t.ipynb`_), and how they are used to
predict fibers (`inference_t.ipynb`_).

`fiber_resampling.ipynb`_
-------------------------
Notebook to resample fibers, and calculate local fiber geometry data, such as
tangent, curvature, and torsion.

`generate_conditional_samples_t.ipynb`_
---------------------------------------
Notebook which defines the generation of samples
(vin, D, vout) for learning the conditional
distribution p((vin| D, vout).

`trk2seeds.ipynb`_
------------------
Small utility notebook to convert the fiber endpoints in a .trk file to seed 
coordinates (.npy).
